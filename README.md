# Codehandler-Wii
The new and improved codehandler for the wii

For a while now, Wii users have had to deal with an unreliable codehandler to execute their gecko codes mid-game.
This version of the gecko codehandler has been reworked to properly update the game's cache after modifing game code,
and also has left out the USB Gecko support (and certain unused codetypes), to maintain as much codespace as possible.
